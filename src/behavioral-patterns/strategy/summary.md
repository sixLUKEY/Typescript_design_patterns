# Summary

- While the Strategy pattern looks very similar to the State pattern, the assigned strategy subclass/algorithm is not changing any state of the context that would affect which algorithm is used.
- The Strategy pattern is about having a choice of implementations that accomplish the same relative task.
- The particular strategies' algorithm is encapsulated in order to keep the implementation de coupled from the context.
- Software Plugins can be implemented using the Strategy pattern.
