# Overview

The Strategy Pattern is similar to the State Pattern, except that the client passes in the algorithm that the context should run.

The algorithm should be contained within a class that implements the particular strategies interface.

An application that sorts data is a good example of where you can incorporate the Strategy pattern.

There are many methods of sorting a set of data. E.g., Quicksort, Mergesort, Introsort, Heapsort, Bubblesort. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm> for more examples.

The user interface of the client application can provide a drop-down menu to allow the user to try the different sorting algorithms.

Upon user selection, a reference to the algorithm will be passed to the context and processed using this new algorithm instead.

The Strategy and State appear very similar, a good way to differentiate them is to consider whether the state of the context is choosing the algorithm at runtime, or whether the algorithm is being passed into it.

Software Plugins can be implemented using the Strategy pattern.

## Terminology

Strategy Interface: An interface that all Strategy subclasses/algorithms must implement.
Concrete Strategy: The subclass that implements an alternative algorithm.
Context: This is the object that receives the concrete strategy in order to execute it.
