# Summary

The Template method defines an algorithm in terms of abstract operations and subclasses override some or all of the methods to create concrete behaviors.

Abstract methods must be overridden in the subclasses that extend the abstract class.

Hook Methods usually have empty bodies in the super class but can be optionally overridden in the subclass.

If a class contains many conditional statements, consider converting it to use the Template Method pattern.
