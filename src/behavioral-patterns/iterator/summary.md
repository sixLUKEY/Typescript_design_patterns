# Summary

- Use an iterator when you need to traverse over a collection, or you want an object that can output a series of dynamically created objects.
- At minimum, an iterator needs a `next` equivalent method that returns an object.
- Optionally you can also create a helper function that indicates whether an iterator is at the end or not. This is useful if you use your iterator in a `while` loop.
