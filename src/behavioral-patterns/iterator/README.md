# Overview

The Iterator will commonly contain two methods that perform the following concepts.

- **next**: returns the next object in the aggregate (collection, object).
- **hasNext**: returns a Boolean indicating if the Iterable is at the end of the iteration or not.

The benefits of using the Iterator pattern are that the client can traverse a collection of aggregates(objects) without needing to understand their internal representations and/or data structures.

## Terminology

- **Iterator Interface**: The Interface for an object to implement.
- **Concrete Iterator**: (Iterable) The instantiated object that implements the iterator and contains a collection of aggregates.
- **Aggregate Interface**: An interface for defining an aggregate (object).
- **Concrete Aggregate**: The object that implements the Aggregate interface.
