# Summary

- A mediator replaces a structure with many-to-many interactions between its classes and processes, with a one-to-many centralized structure where the interface supports all the methods of the many-to-many structure, but via the mediator component instead.
- The mediator pattern encourages usage of shared objects that can now be centrally managed and synchronized.
- The mediator pattern creates an abstraction between two or more components that then makes a system easier to understand and manage.
- The mediator pattern is similar to the Facade pattern, except the Mediator can also transact data both ways between two or more other classes or processes that would normally interact directly with each other.
