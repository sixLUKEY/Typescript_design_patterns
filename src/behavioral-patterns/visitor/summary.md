# Summary

- Use the Visitor pattern to define an operation to be performed on the elements/parts of a hierarchical object structure.
- Use the Visitor pattern to define the new operation without needing to change the classes of the elements/parts on that it operates.
- When designing your application, you can provision for the future possibility of needing to run custom operations on objects, by implementing the Visitor interface in anticipation.
- Usage of the Visitor pattern helps to ensure that your classes conform to the single responsibility principle due to them implementing the custom visitor behavior in a separate class.
