# Summary

- Use the decorator when you want to add responsibilities to objects dynamically without affecting the inner object.
- You want the option to later remove the decorator from an object in case you no longer need it.
- It is an alternative method to creating multiple combinations of subclasses. I.e., Instead of creating a subclass with all combinations of objects A, B, C in any order, and including/excluding objects, you could create 3 objects that can decorate each other in any order you want. E.g., (C(A(C))) or (B(C)) or (A(B(A(C))))
- The decorator, compared to extending, is more flexible since you can easily add/remove the decorators at runtime. E.g., use in a recursive function.
- A decorator supports recursive composition. E.g., halve(halve(number))
- A decorator shouldn't modify the internal objects data or references. This allows the original object to stay intact if the decorator is later removed.
