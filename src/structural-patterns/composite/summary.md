# Summary

The Composite design pattern allows you to structure components in a manageable hierarchical order.
It provides flexibility of structure since you can add/remove and reorder components.
File explorer on Windows is a very good example of the composite design pattern in use.
Any system where you need to offer at runtime the ability to group, ungroup, modify multiple objects at the same time, would benefit from the composite design pattern structure. Programs that allow you to draw shapes and graphics will often also use this structure as well.
