# Source Code

In this concept code, two leaves are created, `LEAF_A` and `LEAF_B`, and two composites are created, `COMPOSITE_1` and `COMPOSITE_2`.

`LEAF_A` is attached to `COMPOSITE_1`.

Then I change my mind and attach `LEAF_A` to `COMPOSITE_2`.

I then attach `COMPOSITE_1` to `COMPOSITE_2`.

`LEAF_B` is not attached to composites.
