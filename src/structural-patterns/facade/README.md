# Overview

Sometimes you have a system that becomes quite complex over time as more features are added or modified. It may be useful to provide a simplified API over it. This is the **Facade** pattern.

The Facade pattern essentially is an alternative, reduced or simplified interface to a set of other interfaces, abstractions and implementations within a system that may be full of complexity and/or tightly coupled.

It can also be considered as a higher-level interface that shields the consumer from the unnecessary low-level complications of integrating into many subsystems.
