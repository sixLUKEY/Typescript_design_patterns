# Builder Use Case

Using the Builder Pattern in the context of a House Builder.

There are multiple directors that can create their own complex objects.

Note that in the IglooDirector class, not all the methods of the HouseBuilder were called.

The builder can construct complex objects in any order and include/exclude whichever parts it likes.
